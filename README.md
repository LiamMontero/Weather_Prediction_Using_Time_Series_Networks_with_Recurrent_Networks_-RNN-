# Data Scientist (Academic Project) â€“ Time Series Prediction with Recurrent Networks (RNN)

## Climate Data Modeling with R, TensorFlow, and Keras 3

I set myself the challenge of forecasting future temperatures based on historical data, using the complex Jena climate dataset. My goal was to apply and compare different neural network architectures to a time series problem, demonstrating a methodical approach to moving from a simple solution to a more sophisticated and effective one.
The first step was rigorous data preprocessing. I normalized the entire dataset and, most importantly, designed and built a custom data generator in R. This feature was crucial for handling the large volume of data efficiently, creating batches of temporal sequences (the last 10 days of data) and their corresponding targets (the temperature 24 hours in the future) on the fly, an essential technique for training Deep Learning models with sequential data.

My modeling strategy was deliberately iterative to demonstrate a process of continuous improvement:
1. Baseline: First, I established a common-sense benchmark, predicting that the future temperature would be equal to the current temperature. This gave me a baseline Mean Absolute Error (MAE) that any more complex model had to surpass to be considered useful.
2. Basic Dense Model: My first attempt at Deep Learning was a simple dense neural network. Although it slightly outperformed the baseline, its performance was limited, as this architecture is not designed to interpret the temporal order of the data.
3. Introduction of Recurrent Networks (GRU): To capture the sequential nature of the problem, I implemented a model with a GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) layer. This model, by having memory of the previous steps, achieved a significant improvement in performance, far outperforming the previous two approaches.
4. Optimization and Improvement: To build a truly robust model, I attacked the overfitting problem by adding Dropout and Recurrent Dropout regularization.

Additionally, I explored deeper architectures, such as stacking multiple GRU layers, and finally, I implemented a Bidirectional GRU model, which allows the network to learn patterns from both past and future sequences.
Each step in this process represented a measurable improvement over the previous one, culminating in a Bidirectional Recurrent Model that proved to be the most effective solution for this forecasting problem.
